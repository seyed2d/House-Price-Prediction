# House Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict **housing prices in California** using machine learning models. The dataset includes various features like geographical location, the number of rooms, population, and proximity to the ocean. The project involves implementing and comparing models such as **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**.

## Project Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning missing values, creating new features, and applying standardization to numeric features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying correlations and visualizing patterns between variables using heatmaps and scatter plots.
- **Model Building and Evaluation**: Training and evaluating multiple models, and optimizing hyperparameters using **Grid Search CV** for better performance.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of data insights and model performance.

## Objective:
To build a **predictive system** capable of estimating housing prices based on the given features with high accuracy.

## Results:
The models achieved reasonable accuracy, with the **Random Forest Regressor** outperforming the **Linear Regression** model in terms of predictive performance.  
**Random Forest Regressor** achieved an **RÂ² score of 0.82** on the test set, while **Linear Regression** achieved a score of **0.79**.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **California Housing Prices dataset**, available on **Kaggle**.
